 # Overview

As a software engineer, I embarked on a personal project to explore and deepen my understanding of the Kotlin programming language. My goal was to create a simple command-line task manager using Kotlin. This project allowed me to apply the language's features, experiment with data classes, and gain practical experience with file I/O operations in Kotlin.

#Description  

The software I developed is a command-line task manager written in Kotlin. It allows users to add, list, remove, mark tasks as completed, and save tasks to a file. The software leverages Kotlin's concise and expressive syntax to create an interactive user experience and manage task data efficiently.  

#Purpose  

The primary purpose of writing this software was to enhance my proficiency in Kotlin. I aimed to gain hands-on experience in using data classes, working with date formatting, and handling file I/O in Kotlin. Additionally, by creating a functional task manager, I intended to demonstrate the language's capability to develop practical applications.

# Development Environment

For this project, I utilized the following development tools and technologies:
•	Kotlin: I wrote the software in the Kotlin programming language, benefiting from its conciseness and readability.
•	IntelliJ IDEA: I used the IntelliJ IDEA integrated development environment for Kotlin development. It provided a rich set of features for code editing and debugging.

#Programming language 
 
The primary programming language for this project was Kotlin. No additional external libraries were used, as the standard Kotlin library provided sufficient functionality for this task manager.

# Future Work

As I continue to work on this project and deepen my knowledge of Kotlin, there are several areas I plan to address in the future: 

- Enhanced User Interface: I intend to improve the user interface to make it more user-friendly, possibly adding more interactive features.

- Error Handling: Implement more robust error handling to gracefully manage unexpected inputs or file-related issues.  

- Task Categories: Allow users to categorize tasks for better organization and filtering.
